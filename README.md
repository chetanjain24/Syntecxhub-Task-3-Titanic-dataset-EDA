# Syntecxhub-Task-3-Titanic-dataset-EDA

# 📌 Internship Project – SyntecxHub

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand survival patterns based on passenger demographics and socio-economic factors.
This project was completed as part of my Data Science & Analytics Internship in Syntecxhub.

# 📂 Dataset Used

Source: Kaggle

Description: The dataset contains passenger information such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, port of embarkation, and survival status.

# 🎯 Project Objectives

Load and inspect the Titanic dataset

Handle missing values and check data types

Analyze survival rates based on:

1. Gender
2. Passenger class
3. Port of embarkation

Visualize findings using:

1. Bar charts
2. Box plots

Derive meaningful insights from the visual analysis

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

# 📊 Visualizations Included

Survival rate by gender (bar chart)

Survival rate by passenger class (bar chart)

Survival rate by embarkation port (bar chart)

Age distribution by survival status (box plot)

Fare distribution by survival status (box plot)

# 🔑 Key Insights

Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than males.

Survival chances decreased from 1st class to 3rd class passengers.

Younger passengers were more likely to survive compared to older passengers.

Passengers who paid higher fares had better survival probabilities.

Survival rates varied across different ports of embarkation.
